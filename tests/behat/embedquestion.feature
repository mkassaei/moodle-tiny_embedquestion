  Scenario: Test using 'Embed question' button
    Given I am on the "Course 1" course page logged in as teacher
    And I turn editing mode on
    When I add a page activity to course "Course 1" section "1"
    And I set the field "Name" to "Test page 01"
    And I set the field "Description" to "Test page description"
    And I set the field "content" to "Test page content"
    And I click on "Embed question" "button"
    And I set the field "Question category" to "Test questions [embed] (1)"
